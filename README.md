# Netology Recommender Systems Mini-Course (2017)

These are several notebooks for practise sessions during a mini-course on Recommender Systems which I created and served for a [Data Science course at Netology](https://netology.ru/programs/data-scientist) in November 2017.

They now belong to [Netology](https://netology.ru) and are available here only as an author's copy.

The full official version and further info about possible re-usage and licensing are available at [Netology GitHub account](https://github.com/netology-code/ds2-fall-2017/tree/master/4.%20Recommender%20Systems).
